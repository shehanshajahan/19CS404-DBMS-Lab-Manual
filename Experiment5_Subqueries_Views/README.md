# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

### Name : Shehan Shajahan
### Register number : 212223240154

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
From the following tables write a SQL query to count the number of customers with grades above the average in New York City. Return grade and count.
customer table

```sql
SELECT grade,COUNT(*) FROM customer WHERE
grade>(SELECT AVG(grade) FROM customer WHERE city='New York') GROUP BY grade;
```

**Output:**

**Question 3**
---
Write a SQL query to Identify customers whose city is different from the city of the customer with the highest ID

SAMPLE TABLE: customer

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE city NOT IN (SELECT city FROM customer WHERE id=(SELECT MAX(ID) FROM customer));
```

**Output:**

**Question 4**
---
Write a SQL query that retrieves the names of students and their corresponding grades, where the grade is equal to the minimum grade achieved in each subject.

Sample table: GRADES (attributes: student_id, student_name, subject, grade)

```sql
SELECT student_name,grade FROM GRADES g WHERE
grade=(SELECT MIN(grade) FROM GRADES WHERE subject=g.subject);
```

**Output:**

salesman table , 
orders table

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE salesman_id=(SELECT salesman_id FROM salesman WHERE name='Paul Adam');
```

**Output:**

**Question 6**
---
From the following tables, write a SQL query to find all the orders generated in New York city. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id and salesman_id.
SALESMAN TABLE AND ORDERS TABLE

```sql
SELECT * FROM ORDERS WHERE salesman_id IN (SELECT salesman_id FROM SALESMAN WHERE city='New York');
```

**Question 7**
---
From the following tables, write a SQL query to determine the commission of the salespeople in Paris. Return commission.

salesman table and customer table

```sql
SELECT commission FROM salesman WHERE salesman_id IN (SELECT salesman_id FROM customer WHERE city = 'Paris');
```

**Output:**

**Question 8**
---
Write a SQL query to Retrieve the medications with dosages equal to the highest dosage
Table Name: Medications (attributes: medication_id, medication_name, dosage)

```sql
SELECT * FROM Medications WHERE dosage=(SELECT MAX(dosage) FROM Medications);
```

**Output:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f71096ae-282a-4b90-a961-6725809a6f32)


**Question 9**
---
Write a SQL query to Retrieve the names of customers who have a phone number that is not shared with any other customer.

SAMPLE TABLE: customer

```sql
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE phone IN (SELECT phone FROM customer GROUP BY phone HAVING COUNT(phone)=1);
```

**Output:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a7e2b77-ccf5-49a7-a17d-93e5c25e3c80)


**Question 10**
---
Write a SQL query to Retrieve the names and cities of customers who have the same city as customers with IDs 3 and 7

SAMPLE TABLE: customer

```sql
SELECT name,city FROM customer WHERE
city IN (SELECT city FROM customer WHERE id IN (3,7));
```

**Output:**
